For this project, analysis of data on GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank will be done to try and identify the relationship between the GDP and life expectancy of six countries.

During this project, the data will be analysed, prepared, and plotted in order to answer the questions in a meaningful way.

This project will use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visalisations.
